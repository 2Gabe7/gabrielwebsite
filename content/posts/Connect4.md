When making Connect 4; I used what I learned from Tic Tac Toe to check for the win, although the math was a little confusing because of the way I set the board up at the start, and I was too far in to switch it. (You can see it in the diagnol check wins) It was a fun challenge to figure out how each piece is dropped in, and test outcomes till I was confident it all worked.

```python
import os
clear = lambda: os.system('clear')
clear()

# Make the board using [x][y]
row6 = ["  ","  ","  ","  ","  ","  ","  "]
row5 = ["  ","  ","  ","  ","  ","  ","  "]
row4 = ["  ","  ","  ","  ","  ","  ","  "]
row3 = ["  ","  ","  ","  ","  ","  ","  "]
row2 = ["  ","  ","  ","  ","  ","  ","  "]
row1 = ["  ","  ","  ","  ","  ","  ","  "]
row = ["0",row1,row2,row3,row4,row5,row6]

# Function to print the connect four board
def c4_board():
    print("            Connect Four         ")
    print("- 1  - 2  - 3  - 4  - 5  - 6  - 7  -",)
